# PHP Performance Test

This is a small app that lets you create scenarios and compare their performance.

All tests contain at least one scenario.

## WIP
This app is fully functional, but also still a work in progress.

### Features
* compare multiple scenarios solving the same problem, and find out which is most efficient;
* scenarios sorted automatically from fastest to slowest;
* easily add your own tests and scenarios;
* run multiple tests in one go.

### To do (in no particular order):
* extend this README:
  * add install instructions
  * add usage instructions
* override sorting
* override run time (currently fixed at 2.5 seconds per scenario)
* automatically pick test from available tests
* better separate abstract/base classes from concrete test classes
* improve output readability
